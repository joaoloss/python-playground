    "In Python, *everything* is an object.\n",
    "  \n",
    "> One of my goals for Python was to make it so that all objects were “first class.” By this, I meant that I wanted all objects that could be named in the language (e.g., integers, strings, functions, classes, modules, methods, etc.) to have equal status. That is, they can be assigned to variables, placed in lists, stored in dictionaries, passed as arguments, and so forth. — Guido Van Rossum\n",
    "\n",
    "Every object has an *identity*, *value*, and *type*: \n",
    "- **Identity**: never changes after the object is created (it's similar to the object's memory address).  \n",
    "  - The `is` operator compares object identities, and the `id()` function returns an integer representing the object's identity (in [CPython](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython), it returns the memory address of the object).  \n",
    "- **Type**: determines the operations an object supports and defines all possible values for that object.  \n",
    "    - Python’s type system: *Duck Typing* (“If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it’s a duck”).  \n",
    "        - With **nominal typing**, an object belongs to a given type only if it is declared as such (or through mechanisms like class inheritance). With **duck typing**, an object is considered to be of a given type if it has all the methods and properties required by that type — therefore, no explicit type checking is needed.  \n",
    "    - Type is immutable.\n",
    "    - The `type()` function returns the object’s type, which is itself an object.  \n",
    "- The **value** of an object (how it \"stores\") may change.\n",
    "    - While `is` checks identity (are both variables pointing to the exact same object in memory?), `==` checks equality (do the objects have the same value?)\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the [source code of CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Include/object.h):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Objects are [C] structures allocated on the heap [...] Objects are never allocated statically or on the stack (Type objects are exceptions to the first rule; the standard types are represented by statically initialized type objects).\n",
    "> \n",
    "> An object has a 'reference count' that is increased or decreased when a pointer to the object is copied or deleted; when the reference count reaches zero there are no references to the object left and it can be removed from the heap. An object has a 'type' that determines what it represents and what kind of data it contains.  An object's type is fixed when it is created. Types themselves are represented as objects; an object contains a pointer to the corresponding type object.  The type itself has a type pointer pointing to itself!\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Objects do not float around in memory; once allocated an object keeps the same size and address.  Objects that must hold variable-size data can contain pointers to variable-size parts of the object.  Not all objects of the same type have the same size; but the size cannot change after allocation.  (These restrictions are made so a reference to an object can be simply a pointer -- moving an object would require updating all the pointers, and changing an object's size would require moving it if there was another object right next to it.)\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Objects are always accessed through pointers of the type 'PyObject *'. The type 'PyObject' is a structure that only contains the reference count and the type pointer. The actual memory allocated for an object contains other data that can only be accessed after casting the pointer to a pointer to a longer structure type.  This longer type must start with the reference count and type fields.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> A standard interface exists for objects that contain an array of items whose size is determined when the object is allocated.\n",

    "**Immutable objects** are objects whose value cannot change after creation (ex.: `int`, `float`, `bool`, `str`, and `tuple`). For those objects, after being instructed to create an instance of an object, Python first checks its existing memory. If an instance of that object already exists, instead of allocating memory to create a new one, it will use the pre-existing value. However, immutability alone does not determine whether Python reuses an existing object or creates a new one: object reuse is an **implementation optimization specific to CPython**, not a language guarantee.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "CPython pre-instantiates and stores **specific instances and ranges of certain immutable types**. These are known as **shared objects**. Internally, they are \"global\" objects that can be reused by all code running within the same interpreter process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation behind this design is performance. Some values appear extremely frequently in programs, and repeatedly allocating memory for them would be wasteful. When such a cached value is needed, Python can simply return a reference to the existing object instead of creating a new one.\n",

Integers outside this range are usually instantiated as new objects, even if they have the same value, unless compiler optimizations apply.\n",
