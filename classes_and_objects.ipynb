    "- Every object has an *identity*, *value*, and *type*.  \n",
    "    - **Identity**: never changes after the object is created (it's similar to the object's memory address).  \n",
    "        - The `is` operator compares object identities, and the `id()` function returns an integer representing the object's identity (in CPython, it returns the memory address of the object).  \n",
    "    - **Type**: determines the operations an object supports and defines all possible values for that object.  \n",
    "        - Python’s type system: *Duck Typing* (“If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it’s a duck”).  \n",
    "            - With **nominal typing**, an object belongs to a given type only if it is declared as such (or through mechanisms like class inheritance). With **duck typing**, an object is considered to be of a given type if it has all the methods and properties required by that type — therefore, no explicit type checking is needed.  \n",
    "        - Type is immutable.  \n",
    "        - The `type()` function returns the object’s type, which is itself an object.  \n",
    "    - The *value* of an object may change.\n",
    "- In Python, everything is an object — including classes: a class is itself an instance of the built-in `type` class, which is the class of classes (including itself)."
